# Focal Transformer for Object Detection

This page explains the details for using Focal Transformers as the backbone for semantic segmentation on ADE20K. 
We build semantic segmentation models based on [mmsegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection). 
More specifically, we follow [Swin-Transformer-Semantic-Segmentation](https://github.com/SwinTransformer/Swin-Transformer-Semantic-Segmentation) to set up our pipelines. 
We will release the model script soon later. Stay tuned!
